PartyCrasher Data Format {version}
*******************************

Overview
========

PartyCrasher expects reports to be formatted in a particular way. This
includes some mandatory properties. Additional properties may be added in
an arbitrary JSON structure as desired, as long as the mandatory properties
are present. In addition, there are some properties which are generated by
PartyCrasher itself and should be avoided in any uploaded data.

Mandatory Fields
================

.. highlight:: JSON

date
----

The ``date`` peroperty specifies the canonical date of the report. This
may be when the report was created, submitted, processed. It should be the
most reliable date that is available. It must be ISO formatted, and be
in UTC (no timezone). Due to the way ElasticSearch handles dates, 
other dates may be 
specified but they must be added to a list in PartyCrasher so that
PartyCrasher knows they are dates and not strings.

.. code-block:: JSON

  {
    ...
    "date": "2007-06-18T19:23:43",
